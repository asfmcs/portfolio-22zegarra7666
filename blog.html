                    <td> "Hello World!" Is the first thing we learnt how to write in HTML. In Computers Class we've been learning many, <strong>many</strong> things in just a few weeks. I've come a far way, going from no knowledge what so ever, to easily being able to format a website (altough simple, very complex) with different colors, pictures, fonts, and links within. I've come a long way from not even knowing what HTML or CSS even meant or was. I've learnt about 'classes' and 'ID's' (knowing how to modify a specific), I've also learnt about formatting my html itself, so that it is readble, understandable and legible not only by the computer but the teacher and myself as well. <br> <br>
                    
                   In this unit we first started with some lessons in Khan Academy that taught us the most basic things, like how to write a heading, the different sizes of headings, going from the biggest size (h1) to the smallest size (h6). Then we learned how to write text, which is just a simple "p" in between arrow brackets "<>". Then we learned many other things like formatting a page, making space (aka breaks) in between our paragraphs or any content what so ever. We also learnt how to add color o our backgrounds, our text, changing the color of the text itself, adding pictures and then applying our knowledge into a simple website fully created and programmed by us.   </td>

<div class="tables"> <table style="width:100%"> 
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th> Entry #2 </th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td> At first learning how to wirte in HTML was a little overwhelming, but Khan Academy helped me a lot, it was a bunch of small steps slowly adding up, going from simple text, to formatting, colors, pictures and then you put it al in to practice. I do have to admit that using my knowledge to then make a website was a little frustrating, it was hard to know which codes to use so I usually had to go back and forth from HTML, Khan Academy and W3Schools, but after a while after excercises and constant practicing you learn to get the hang of it.  <br> <br>
                    
                    It wasn't just HTML, but CSS as well. HTML involves the content and the programming of something, however, CSS can be  much more complex because it involves all the looks and how everything in your or any webpage is arranged. The process can turn quite repetitive, almost to the point that you could copy paste many things, of course making slight changes to make things work. This is specially true when formatting titles or tables. After a while you do get the hang of it and codes will not be so difficult, In the end, although we're not done, I have really enjoyed this unit and it has really opened my eyed to a whole to new technological field, that I didn't/hadn't acknowledged just yet. It was very fun to see how different it is to create your own website from 0, than it is creating it on a website like Wix or Weebly. I hope to keep learning and I would like to pursue website page making seen as I really enjoy Graphic Design and Visual Arts.</td>
